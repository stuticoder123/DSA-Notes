The Sliding Window technique is a powerful approach used in solving problems that involve arrays or lists. It’s especially useful when dealing with contiguous subarrays
or substrings, and it helps optimize solutions from O(n²) to O(n).

Q.) What is the Sliding Window technique?
- Instead of checking all possible subarrays, you "slide" a window (a range of elements) over the data structure and keep track of a subset of data to compute the 
result efficiently

Q.) When to use it?
Use Sliding Window when :
- You are dealing with contiguous elements (subarrays or substrings).
- You need to optimize time complexity.
- The problem asks for maximum/minimum sum, length, or number of elements under certain conditions.

Types of Sliding Window :
Fixed Size Window – When the window size is known beforehand.
Variable Size Window – When the window size changes based on a condition.

Common Questions Using Sliding Window : Maximum sum subarray of size k
                                        Longest substring with k distinct characters
                                        Longest substring without repeating characters
                                        Minimum window substring (hard)
                                        Permutation in string

A Segment Tree is used to stores information about array intervals in its nodes.It allows efficient range queries over array intervals. Along with queries, it allows efficient updates of array items.
For example : we can perform a range summation of an array between the range L to R in O(Log n) while also modifying any array element in O(Log n) Time
